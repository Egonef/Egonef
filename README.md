### Hi there, I'm Emilio! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate computer science student with a knack for creativity. Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering.

My heart lies in the world of **Frontend Development**, where I weave my design and coding skills to craft beautiful and user-friendly interfaces. I'm also an avid explorer of the exciting realm of **Game Development**, constantly seeking new ways to bring interactive experiences to life.

Beyond code, I'm really keen on **total customization (ricing)**, especially on my Linux setup. I enjoy tweaking every pixel and configuration to create a personalized digital environment that's uniquely mine.

I thrive on learning new languages and development techniques, always eager to expand my knowledge and skill set. If you're looking for a versatile, creative, and forward-thinking collaborator, I'd love to connect!

Let's build the future together, one line of code at a time. ðŸš€
